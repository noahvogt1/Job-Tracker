                <h3>1. Purpose of the Service</h3>
                <p>
                    Job Tracker is a personal productivity tool designed to help you discover, save,
                    and track job opportunities and related application activities. It is not an
                    applicant tracking system for employers and does not submit applications on
                    your behalf unless explicitly integrated and configured to do so.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section class="content-card">
                <h3>2. Your Responsibilities</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>You are responsible for the accuracy of any data you enter (jobs, notes, applications, offers, etc.).</li>
                    <li>You agree not to store unlawful, offensive, or third‑party confidential information without permission.</li>
                    <li>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account credentials.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section class="content-card">
                <h3>3. Data &amp; Integrations</h3>
                <p>
                    Job Tracker may ingest job data from external sources (e.g., job boards, company
                    career pages). These sources remain the authoritative systems of record. Links
                    to external postings are provided for convenience and may change or expire.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section class="content-card">
                <h3>4. No Guarantees</h3>
                <p>
                    While Job Tracker aims to give you a clear, accurate view of your job search,
                    it does not guarantee any specific outcomes, including interviews, offers, or
                    employment. Use insights as guidance, not as legal or financial advice.
                </p>

                <h3>5. Acceptable Use</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Do not attempt to break, overload, or abuse the service.</li>
                    <li>Do not use Job Tracker to harass, spam, or misrepresent yourself to others.</li>
                    <li>Respect the terms of any third‑party data sources you connect to or import from.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>6. Changes to These Terms</h3>
                <p>
                    These Terms of Service may evolve over time. When they do, the “Last updated”
                    date will be revised and you may be asked to re‑accept them if changes are
                    significant.
